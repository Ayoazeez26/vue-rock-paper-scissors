## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vuex
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS library
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned more practical use of Vuex, using TailwindCSS with Vue, I made use of slots in a project for the first time. I also made use of the transition component for the first time

### Continued development

In future projects, I would love to focus on Vuex, animations, comsuming API, using slots, all with Vue js.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This helped me with issues I had using slots and I got answers to my problems.
- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://www.tailwindcss.com) - I used this for checking out class names and their functions in Tailwind.
